"""Contains definitions for the original form of Residual Networks.

The 'v1' residual networks (ResNets) implemented in this module were proposed
by:
[1] Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
    Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. arXiv:1512.03385

Other variants were introduced in:
[2] Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
    Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks. arXiv: 1603.05027

The networks defined in this module utilize the bottleneck building block of
[1] with projection shortcuts only for increasing depths. They employ batch
normalization *after* every weight layer. This is the architecture used by
MSRA in the Imagenet and MSCOCO 2016 competition models ResNet-101 and
ResNet-152. See [2; Fig. 1a] for a comparison between the current 'v1'
architecture and the alternative 'v2' architecture of [2] which uses batch
normalization *before* every weight layer in the so-called full pre-activation
units.

Typical use:

   from tensorflow.contrib.slim.nets import resnet_v1

ResNet-101 for image classification into 1000 classes:

   # inputs has shape [batch, 224, 224, 3]
   with slim.arg_scope(resnet_v1.resnet_arg_scope()):
      net, end_points = resnet_v1.resnet_v1_101(inputs, 1000, is_training=False)

ResNet-101 for semantic segmentation into 21 classes:

   # inputs has shape [batch, 513, 513, 3]
   with slim.arg_scope(resnet_v1.resnet_arg_scope()):
      net, end_points = resnet_v1.resnet_v1_101(inputs,
                                                21,

  """Generator for v1 ResNet models.

  This function generates a family of ResNet v1 models. See the resnet_v1_*()
  methods for specific model instantiations, obtained by selecting different
  block instantiations that produce ResNets of various depths.

  Training for image classification on Imagenet is usually done with [224, 224]
  inputs, resulting in [7, 7] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet
  block for the ResNets defined in [1] that have nominal stride equal to 32.
  However, for dense prediction tasks we advise that one uses inputs with
  spatial dimensions that are multiples of 32 plus 1, e.g., [321, 321]. In
  this case the feature maps at the ResNet output will have spatial shape
  [(height - 1) / output_stride + 1, (width - 1) / output_stride + 1]
  and corners exactly aligned with the input image corners, which greatly
  facilitates alignment of the features to the image. Using as input [225, 225]
  images results in [8, 8] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet block.

  For dense prediction tasks, the ResNet needs to run in fully-convolutional
  (FCN) mode and global_pool needs to be set to False. The ResNets in [1, 2] all
  have nominal stride equal to 32 and a good choice in FCN mode is to use
  output_stride=16 in order to increase the density of the computed features at
  small computational and memory overhead, cf. http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915.

  Args:
    inputs: A tensor of size [batch, height_in, width_in, channels].
    blocks: A list of length equal to the number of ResNet blocks. Each element
      is a resnet_utils.Block object describing the units in the block.
    num_classes: Number of predicted classes for classification tasks. If None
      we return the features before the logit layer.
    is_training: whether is training or not.
    global_pool: If True, we perform global average pooling before computing the
      logits. Set to True for image classification, False for dense prediction.
    output_stride: If None, then the output will be computed at the nominal
      network stride. If output_stride is not None, it specifies the requested
      ratio of input to output spatial resolution.
    include_root_block: If True, include the initial convolution followed by
      max-pooling, if False excludes it.
    reuse: whether or not the network and its variables should be reused. To be
      able to reuse 'scope' must be given.
    scope: Optional variable_scope.

  Returns:
    net: A rank-4 tensor of size [batch, height_out, width_out, channels_out].
      If global_pool is False, then height_out and width_out are reduced by a
      factor of output_stride compared to the respective height_in and width_in,
      else both height_out and width_out equal one. If num_classes is None, then
      net is the output of the last ResNet block, potentially after global
      average pooling. If num_classes is not None, net contains the pre-softmax
      activations.
    end_points: A dictionary from components of the network to the corresponding
      activation.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the target output_stride is not valid.
